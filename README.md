# my-little-video-game
A vintage style video game class that is very basic and written in python.  This is my first try at using object oriented programming.

I took a class in Python at a local community college, watched the series "Tkinter Course - Create Graphic User Interfaces in Python Tutorial" from Codemy.com.  I also
read the book.  I also read the book Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science by John Zelle.  This is my first try at using Object Oriented Programming.

There are really 2 classes I am making, they are very simple.
The first class is a basically a GUI called MyLittleVideoGame with methods for getting keystrokes, showing messages, displaying a background, etc.
The second class are called LittleObjects.  They will have limited methods and attributes, basically an image file, x y positions, move by x and move y, etc.

A main point of using these classes is to make a 2d video game, reminiscient of Atari 2600 or Commodore 64 very quickly.

The classes will use basic common libraries like tkinter, playsound, pygame for sound.
